Web Scrapping 
- is when a program goes through a copy of the websites html and getting the info from the page.
- is useful because not all programs offer an api to get data.  

Unless there is a paywall/subscription, information on the internet is considered public information.

pipenv shell
pipenv install requests
##         ^^ module that causes your terminal to act like a browser (html)

get url in a variable. 

pipenv install beautifulsoup4
##         ^^ module that takes the html and turns them into objects to access easier. 

soup = BeautifulSoup(page.content,'html.parser')
##                                    ^^ there are a lot of different parsers out there. 

job_titles = soup.find_all('h2')
##                 ^^ find_all always returns a list, even if there is 1 or 0 results

for job in job_titles:
  print(job.text)
